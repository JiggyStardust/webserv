# We define the server inside a {} block, in which we have blocks for...
# ...keywords: 
	#listen IP:port  		(tells the server to bind to this IP and port)
	#server_name 
	#client_max_body_size 	(in bytes, limits upload or post data size)
	#error_page (define all different error pages, 404 for example) 
		# errors starting with 4 (400->) are for client/user end errors, so maybe we could define those?

# ...locations for different methods and keywords:
	# GET
	# POST
	# delete
	# return (redirection code and the path of redirection)

# autoindex on, server will dynamically build a HTML page listing files and sub-directorys under requested directory
# autoindex off, if directory is requested and thereâ€™s no index file, the server will not list its contents -> usually returns 403 error
